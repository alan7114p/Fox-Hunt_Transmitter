# Fox-Hunt_Transmitter
2M FM Transmitter for ICARC

This project is to design and build a 2 Meter, FM transmitter to use in a hidden transmitter hunt ('Fox Hunt').  This is produced for the Island County (WA) Amateur Radio Club.  It is based on an Arduino Nano, an Adafruit Si5351 Breakout board and a custom designed PCB.  The custom PCB contains a Phase Modulator, an output Low Pass Filter (LPF) and a 5 volt linear voltage regulator.

This is the first project that I have designed.  It is undoubtedly crude by the standards of many, but it has been (and continues to be) a terrific learning experience, both about coding and VHF FM.
